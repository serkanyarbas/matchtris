# MatchTris
MatchTris is a tetris clone and the main objective is to match at least 3 same color objects "balls" in any way, horizontal, vertical or diagonal.

The original code was written on 2004-2005, actually I could not remember exactly, for mobile phones using the J2ME technology.

The code was staying idle in my backups (multiple with different labels). I try to merge the codes, because I was not sure which of them is the recent one.

At first I merged using the gits diff tools, then one month later I try to do a quick port to JSE as a simple applet. There are lots of things to do still.

If you want to participate just clone it and start contributing.
